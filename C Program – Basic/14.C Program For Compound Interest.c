//14.C Program For Compound Interest

//Compound Interest formula:

//Formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by: 
//Amount= P(1 + R/100)t

//Compound Interest = Amount â€“ P
//Where, 
//P is principal amount 
//R is the rate and 
//T is the time span

//Input: Principal (amount):1200
//                   		Time: 2
//                   		Rate: 5.4
//Output: Compound Interest = 133.099243
